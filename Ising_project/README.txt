Simulation of 2D ISING lattice
-aswin & ishita

The python script has a lot of strict
dependencies viz numpy, matplotlib,PIL

The C  version is the same implementat-
ion the algorithm but is dedicated for 
terminal dependent visualization.The C 
code strictly depends on the pseud-random
number generator 'Mersene-Twister'.
Please link math library for compilation '-lm'.


The visualization ising.mp4 is made with python,
whereas the the timelapse is a screen record of 
the o/p of main.c
